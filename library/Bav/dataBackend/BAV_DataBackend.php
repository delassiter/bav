/**
 * The BAV_DataBackend is an abstract class which is responsable for the
 * datastructure of the banks. If you want to use a custom datastructure
 * you have to implement these methods:
 *
 * install(), update(), uninstall(), getNewBank(), getAllBanks(), _getMainAgency(),
 * _getAgencies()
 * 
 * When you use this class you should create only one object. The BAV_DataBackend
 * is designed to keep all created BAV_Bank objects in an array. So you won't get
 * copies of identical BAV_Bank objects. That means if you call two times the
 * getBank() methode with the same id, you will receive each time the same object.
